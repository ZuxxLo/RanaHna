## Key Features:

### 1-User Authentication:

-Users can sign up and log in securely using email and password authentication.

Browse and view available rides posted by other users.

### 3-Ride Booking:

## Note:
This one-day project is a simplified prototype, and certain advanced features of a complete ride-sharing platform (like payment processing, advanced user profiles, review systems) may not be implemented within the given timeframe. The goal is to showcase the core functionalities of creating, viewing, and booking rides in a simple and intuitive manner.
